## appimagedl

appimagedl is a command line AppImage manager that integrates with [AppImageHub](https://appimage.github.io).
appimagedl uses https://appimage.github.io/feed.json to get information about
approved AppImages from AppImageHub.  If possible, 'appimageupdatetool' is used
to keep AppImages up to date.  Otherwise, 'jq' and 'wget' are used to get the latest
release information using Github's API.

appimagedl is not responsible for bugs within AppImages that have been
downloaded using appimagedl.  Please report any bugs that are specific to
downloaded AppImages to their maintainers.

## Github Rate Limit

By default, Github's rate limit for API checks is 60 per hour.  When authenticated, the rate limit is increased to 5000 per hour.  To take advantage of the increased rate limit, it is suggested that you add your token to `appimagedl.conf`.

It is recommended that you do not give this token access to ***any*** scopes as it will be stored in plain text in your config file.  It may even be a good idea to create a throwaway account for use with this.

To use authenticated Github API checks with appimagedl, edit the following line in `~/.config/appimagedl/appimagedl.conf` to contain your token:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"
```

## Enable a local $PATH to run the programs as binary files

To run the AppImages from the command line (command `appimagedl download $PROGRAM`), add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc:

    export PATH=$PATH:$(xdg-user-dir USER)/.local/bin
You can quickly do that using the following command:

    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(xdg-user-dir USER)/.local/bin' >> ./.bashrc


## What is an [AppImage](http://appimage.org)?

An AppImage is a downloadable file for Linux that contains an application and everything the application needs to run (e.g., libraries, icons, fonts, translations, etc.) that cannot be reasonably expected to be part of each target system.
